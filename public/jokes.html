                        A programmer is sent to the grocery store with instructions to "buy butter and see whether they have eggs, if they do, then buy 10."<br/>

                        "Come on, you guys! Everyone knows mine is the oldest profession," said the hooker.<br/>

                        "Ah," said the architect, "but before your profession existed, there had to be people, and who was there before people?"<br/>

                        "What are you getting at, God?" The hooker asked.<br/>

                        "And was He not the divine architect of the universe?" The architect asked, looking smug.<br/>

                        The programmer had been silent, but now he spoke up. "And before God took on himself the role of an architect, what was there?"<br/>

                        "Darkness and chaos," the hooker said.<br/>

                        "And who do you think created chaos?" the programmer said.</p>
